## Hi, I'm Leena ðŸ‘‹

I'm class 2025 full stack developer student at SASKY, Huittinen, transitioning from teaching Finnish language and literature to IT. My niche is yet to find, because I tend to take interest in everything. :grin:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final React project of my full stack studies in SASKY.
- ðŸŒ± Next I will take part in a four-month CMS course which will complete my studies.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first coding experiment was in 2004 with Pine from which I switched to studying natural languages for years. I found my way back to programming in 2022. I realized I loved Excel above all else in my job as a Finnish teacher.
- :green_heart: I'm looking for an internship or an entry level job in frontend and/or backend development.
