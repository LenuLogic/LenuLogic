  Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Class of 2025 full-stack development student at SASKY, Huittinen, transitioning from teaching Finnish language and literature to IT. My niche is yet to be found, as I tend to take an interest in everything. :blush:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final frontend project for my full-stack studies at SASKY. It is a collaborative student project to create a browser-based digital signage system. It is intended for real-life use once it is finished.
- ðŸŒ± Next I will take part in a four-month CMS course which will complete my studies.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first coding experiment was in 2004 with Pine from which I switched to studying natural languages for years. I found my way back to programming in 2022. I realized I enjoyed the IT side of my job too much.

- :green_heart: I'm looking for an internship or an entry level job in frontend and/or backend development.
