## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final React project of my full stack studies.
- ðŸŒ± Next I will take part in a four-month CMS course.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first coding experiment was in 2004 with Pine from which I switched to studying natural languages for years. I found my way back to programming in 2022. I realized I loved Excel above all else in my job as a Finnish teacher.
