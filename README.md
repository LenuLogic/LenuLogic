  Hey there! 
</h1> 
</div>

I'm a Class of 2025 full-stack development student at SASKY, Huittinen, transitioning from teaching Finnish language and literature to IT. My interests are wide-ranging, and mastering any new skill equals happiness to me. :blush:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking into Scrum and Kanban, because I want to know more about how an agile development process works.
- ðŸŒ± Next I will take part in a three-month CMS course which will complete my studies.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first coding experiment was in 2004 with Pine from which I switched to studying natural languages for years. I found my way back to programming in 2022. I realized I enjoyed the IT side of my job a bit too much to stick with teaching.

- :green_heart: I'm looking for an internship or an entry level job in frontend and/or backend development or project management.
